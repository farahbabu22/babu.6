# Assignment 6 - Memory management using virutal memory (paging) in operating system

A memory management module is simulated for this program which implements virtual memory paging using a second chance FIFO page replacement algorithm. In case of a page fault it will be swapped.

### Design of the assignment

#### clock.h
* To define the structure for clock with seconds and nano seconds used in logging and timekeeping

#### vm.h
* Defining the virutal memory related parameters
- Access Time
- Swap Time
- Page Size
- Page Count
- Frame Count which is 256K
- Structure of the Page
- Structure of the frame

#### process.h
* process states
- Ready
- Swap
- Terminated

#### oss.h
* oss structure definition for virutal memory management
* oss function declarations

#### master.c
* Main program to control the execution takes in the no of process attributes
* Implement the queue algorithm FIFO
* FIFO push and pop algorithm behavior is defined in this program. 
* bit set or bit map to handle the page thrashing / swapping is handled.
* frame operation management is also handled in this program. 
* System calls used
- fork - to spawn a new thread
- excel - run system command
- shmget - to get shared memory
- semget - to get semaphore for IPC
- semctl - to change semaphore controls
- shmctl - to change shared memory options
- shmdt - to remove the shared memory
- semop - to modify semaphore options

#### user.c
* To emulate the user process
* The user process will seek for memory


#### oss.c
* IPC program for OSS simulation

#### fifo_daemon.c
* To handle the queuing logic

### Execution
Clean the entire project using the below command
> make clean

make the project
> make

run the project
> ./master -p <number of processes>

view the output
> cat master.log | more

#### Issues faced
- sometimes if the process are around 17/18 the programs is unable to schedule properly and takes over 10 seconds to run. 
- In such situations please run the program with options < 14
